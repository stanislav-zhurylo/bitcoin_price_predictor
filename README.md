### Using Classes

This was my first time building such a model with TensorFlow/Keras.  

### Regular Re-Training and Deployment. 

Since Bitcoin trades around the clock, it’s straightforward to retrain the model and test it on fresh data. However, because our predictions rely solely on Bitcoin’s price, I’m skeptical about its performance. Still, it would be valuable to measure how well the model behaves in a real production setting.

## Libraries Used

I used Python and the following libraries:
* TensorFlow (and Keras) 2.4 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn 
* Wandb
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Tqdm
